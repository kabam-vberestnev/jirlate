# Some simple test

# Will it work?

That, we obviously do not know. But we can try to make a _test_ markdown file.
Add list of things, such as:
- lol
- kek
- peq

## Then finally

In the last section, write some `inline` code as well as leave a proper block:
```
keque
peque
```

# Extras

Throwing in [some links](https://example.org "some links"), **bolded text**.

Strike-through ~~didn't work~~ works!
